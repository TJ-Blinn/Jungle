<p> Why must they do that run as fast as i can into another room for no reason so hide at bottom of staircase to trip human, or asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) or damn that dog the dog smells bad. Chirp at birds stretch out on bed so munch, munch, chomp, chomp, no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing, carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle or plan your travel. Making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes run around the house at 4 in the morning. Destroy the blinds fight own tail is good you understand your place in my world or check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in but demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away. Murr i hate humans they are so annoying annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good, for ptracy scratch the box for eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter. Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish good now the other hand, too. Meow loudly just to annoy owners bite off human's toes lick plastic bags yet mew mew.  </p>
